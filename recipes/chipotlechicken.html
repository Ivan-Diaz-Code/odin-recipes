      <li>2 dried guajillo chilies</li>
      <li>2 dried ancho chilies</li>
      <li>4 dried mushrooms</li>
      <li>1.5 cups boiling water</li>
      <li>2 tsp (4g) coriander seeds, toasted</li>
      <li>2 tsp (4g) cumin seeds, toasted</li>
      <li>7oz (200g) can chipotle peppers in adobo</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 tsp (3g) ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>2 tsp (12g) kosher salt</li>
      <li>4 Tbsp chili oil or just neutral flavored oil</li>
      <li>1.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken thigh</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by removing the seeds and tops of the chilis. Place skins in a
        bowl along with mushrooms and cover with boiling water. Cover with
        plastic wrap and let steep.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small dry pan, add in the coriander seeds and cumin seeds. Set over
        medium heat and heat until fragrant. 1-2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add toasted seeds into a blender and blend on high speed until a powder
        forms.
      </li>
      <li>
        To that add rehydrated chilis, mushrooms, some soaking liquid, chipotle
        peppers, ground cinnamon, kosher salt, and juice of 1 lime. Blend until
        smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        While vortexing and blending, stream in chili oil. Blend until oil
        emulsifies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken into a medium bowl, cover and toss in the marinade,
        cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1
        hour to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pan, coat the bottom with enough oil and heat over
        medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the chicken. Flip often until the chicken is cooked through and
        browned on the outside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optionally, sear the chicken on both sides then add to a sheet tray and
        into the oven set to 400F until fully cooked through (165 F).
      </li>
    </ol>
